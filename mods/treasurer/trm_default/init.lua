--[[
	This is an example Treasure Registration Mod (TRM) for the default mod.
	It is meant to use together with the default mod and the treasurer mod.

	This TRM registers a bunch of items found in the default mod.

	Note that the probabilities may not be very well balanced,
	this file is just there as an example. It, however, can
	still be used in actual gameplay.

	A TRM is really nothing more than a list of item names, probabilities,
	preciousnesses, and optionally a given amount and tool wear.
	The only function ever called is treasurer.register_treasure.
	See also treasurerâ€™s documentation for more info.
