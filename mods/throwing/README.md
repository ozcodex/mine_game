* [`throwing`](https://git.fwhost.eu/MT-Eurythmia/throwing), an API for registering throwing and throwable things,
* [`throwing_arrow`](https://git.fwhost.eu/MT-Eurythmia/throwing_arrows), a compatible replacement for the throwing mod by PilzAdam using the throwing API.

Development of the mods happen in the upstream repositories, please send you pull requests there!
