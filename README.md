# mine_game
Mine game, use the minetest game engine. https://github.com/minetest/minetest

# Why
There are a lot of things that i loved of minetest and its mods, but also a
lot of things that i hated, the ggod thing about open source is that i can 
change the game as i wants... so that is what im doing.
