# Mine Game
Mine game, use the [Minetest](https://github.com/minetest/minetest) game engine.

The name of the game makes a word play with both meanings of mine, the mining
component of the game and the fact that this specific version of the game is
mine.

I started to used the modified version of the game by PetiAPocok 
[Minetest Extended](https://github.com/PetiAPocok/minetest_extended), I really
liked what he do with some mods and the core of the game.
Some things still needs changes, and some changes i didnt liked, so is a mix of
a lot of sources.

# Why
There are a lot of things that i loved of minetest and its mods, but also a
lot of things that i hated, the ggod thing about open source is that i can 
change the game as i wants... so that is what im doing.
